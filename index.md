# Welcome to the **DiddiOS** website!

**DiddiOS** is an in-development operative system created by [Diego Ramirez](https://DiddiLeija.github.io), which is intended
to be developer-friendly, safe, and easy to set up.

## Basis

This OS is based on the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org), by [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds).
**It is on development, so it is not ready to be used (not yet...).**
Our goal is create an OS friendlier with developers, safer, and easier to use.
